                        <p><b>Because websites need to have a reason behind them or else it is a page with a bunch of random code. We do a lot of planning and brainstorming on different ideas to be able to better develop every website we make. One such example is me and my partners <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1drglx1FBJ1o9s6hBiCMMX-liela5-1moJ7wq16lMGek/edit?usp=sharing">Anxiety App Presentation</a> where we had to come up with an innovation that can help a disabled person, this can be physically, due to where they live, or any other reason.  </b> </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>This was a really good planning sheet because me and my partner were able to communicate really well and we both comprised on our first ideas. Because we ended up thinking as far as we did into this I wanted to reach out and contact different local mental health counselors in the Fresno area. I found a really smart Fresno State Graduate who had multiple student honor awards and even had a news article dedicated to her community work that she did as a student. Unfortunately I there was never any communication but me and my partner both agreed that having a creditable source for the content of our App was a must. </b></p>
