                        <p>Hello, my name is Joseph Flores and this is my About Me. I was homeschooled for all of my life up until 11th grade. I was born in Seaside, CA, in a house really close to the beach. I have good memories of my childhood, before I got my iPad 2 I was an avid reader. I had all my books in my room that I had read at least twice. I was able to build entire worlds, a land unknown, all the cool things as most kids imagine. I have recently started reading books again because it's healthy and fun for me.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>I had a rough time being homeschooled, I didn’t have a schedule or anything to keep me in check and fell way off into the deep end in productivity in ninth and tenth grade. I crammed everything from the year in 4 months so I did not have to redo ninth grade. I barely got Bs across the board that year. I learned that I can do a lot more than I thought possible when it comes to school. I know my limits now, academically at least. I know that I can do anything I set my eyes on.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>When I was in Wisconsin visiting family. I did some farm work for one of their friends, it was fun. I enjoyed being out there early in the morning and going home dead dog tired. One memory I have of that place is when I was running the length of a fence to see where the cows knocked it down to escape. I sunk into 2 feet of mud, all the way up past my knees. I was afraid that it went deeper and it might cover my chest and head to suffocate me. But it stopped at my thighs and I flopped around very slowly out of the mud. That and I got zapped by an electric cow fence which is a higher voltage due to their thick hides. The dude who owned the farm scammed us, we busted our butts and counted out one thousand chickens of two hundred different or more breeds. He never paid me, my cousins or brother and sister. But the adults just said to let bygones be bygones because they knew he was financially struggling.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>When I started school at CHS I was living in my moms friends living room. We had some complications with the previous owners of our house and could not move in before school started. That was a trying time for sure. I am glad that it worked out and we stabilized fast. We were able to adapt like we did because I used to live in a trailer park. Due to the limited space of an RV I couldn’t run in a room and shut the door so I was compelled to talk out problems. I am glad for what I learned and how I grew in these situations and am even more excited about how I will become in the future when adult life starts for me.</p>
