                        <p><b>I will talk about how this is one of my first projects. There are many things that could improve on this. There were many revisions of the story to make it multiple choice. There could be a better home as well, because the game just starts off on load it feels like they are being thrown into it. A menu with a ‘start’ and possibly even a ‘end’ page would have been cool to see. I learned how to make a running HTML page and how to use buttons on this project.  <a href="https://flamboyant-williams-2597f3.netlify.app/">link</a>  </b> </p>
